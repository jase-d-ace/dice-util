# Dice Util

Got bored, built a dice rolling program.

Needed a bunch of D6s to build a new character, but I didn't have a whole bunch of D6s on me (I know, I'm the worst DnD player).

So I figured why not build an entire dice util. 3 functions total, a bunch of constants so that I don't have to continually replace values everywhere just in case by some miracle I decide to expand this.

Yes, I'm still using old school `require`. I'll get around to changing it later.

Used four separate files just for giggles and for `separation of concerns` because importance.

Currently working on a React front end for this project; progress can be seen under the `react-refactor` branch of this repo
